A high-performance scientific fact-checking engine that verifies claims against peer-reviewed literature using a Retrieval Augmented Natural Language Inference (NLI) pipeline.

Overview
Verity is a full-stack application that combines dense vector retrieval with cross-encoder re-ranking to verify scientific and medical claims. It processes claims through a Rust-powered backend API, retrieves relevant documents from a Qdrant vector database, and analyzes evidence stance using ONNX-optimized transformer models.

Key Features:
Verity was built to prioritize concurrency, hallucination resistance, and hardware efficiency without relying on expensive cloud GPUs or black-box LLMs.

Lock-Free Concurrency via Object Pooling: Utilizes the deadpool crate to manage thread-local instances of ONNX models, achieving lock-free parallel execution across CPU cores.
Tokio Thread Offloading: Synchronous, CPU-heavy matrix math (Session::run()) is seamlessly offloaded to background blocking threads using web::block. This ensures the Actix-Web event loop remains unblocked and responsive to incoming network traffic.
Deterministic NLI Chunking: Prevents "Attention Dilution" by sanitizing and isolating document abstracts into sliding 2-sentence windows before passing them to the Cross-Encoder.
Advanced Stance Aggregation: Calculates document stances via Chunk-Level Max Pooling, and determines the final system verdict using Weighted Thresholded Sum Pooling.
Dynamic Radius Retrieval: Prevents the "Closed-World Fallacy" problem by enforcing strict baseline Qdrant similarity scores and a dynamic radius (0.05) to filter out statistical outliers.

How It Works
Claim Embedding: The user's claim is received by the Rust API and tokenized. The BGE-Small Bi-Encoder generates a 384-dimensional dense semantic vector.
Context Retrieval & Filtering: The vector is sent to Qdrant to retrieve the top 9 most semantically similar documents. The system applies a strict hard threshold (0.55) and a dynamic radius filter to instantly reject out-of-domain documents.
Windowed Chunking: Retrieved abstracts are sanitized, split by terminal punctuation, and grouped into sliding 2-sentence windows to preserve grammatical context for the NLI model.
Thread-Offloaded Inference: The Actix worker requests a PubMedBERT Cross-Encoder from the Object Pool and offloads the chunk-claim pairs to a Tokio background thread. The model outputs raw logits which are converted to SoftMax probabilities (SUPPORT, REFUTE, NEUTRAL).
Mathematical Aggregation: The system performs Max Pooling to find the strongest signal in each document. It then multiplies the NLI confidence by the Qdrant semantic score, filtering out weak signals (<65%), and performs a Weighted Sum Pooling to declare the final TRUE, FALSE, or NEUTRAL verdict.

API Usage
Verify a Claim
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "claim": "Mitochondria play a major role in apoptosis.",
    "qdrant_threshold": 0.55
  }'
Response:

{
  "final_verdict": "TRUE",
  "aggregate_confidence": 0.92,
  "evidence": [
    {
      "title": "Mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis",
      "source": "scifact",
      "snippet": "Mitochondria are essential for...",
      "stance": "SUPPORT",
      "confidence": 0.89
    }
  ]
}
Benchmarking
Evaluate the system against the hybrid dataset:

# Run benchmark with Docker
docker run --rm -it --network host \
  -v "$(pwd):/app" -w /app \
  python:3.10-slim bash -c \
  "pip install requests && API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/verify python benchmark.py"
The benchmark evaluates:

Per-class precision, recall, and F1 scores
Weighted F1 across TRUE/FALSE/NEUTRAL labels
Hyperparameter tuning for optimal Qdrant thresholds
Data Sources
Verity relies on a custom "Hybrid Corpus" to ensure robust, real-world fact-checking capabilities. The offline Python ingestion pipeline consolidates data from:

SciFact: 5,000+ expert-written scientific claims paired with evidence-annotated abstracts from peer-reviewed publications.
HealthVer: A dataset specifically designed for medical claim verification, providing real-world public health claims.
BioLaySumm & LaySumm: Biomedical lay summaries integrated to increase vocabulary diversity and domain variability.
